## TODO
- [ ] Add modular encryption for communications
- [ ] Setup standard communication method throughout protocols
- [ ] Exploitation Framework
    - [ ] Use established exploits (for now use published ones)
    - [ ] Custom exploit file/folder (set with optparse)
    - [ ] Exploit customization (LHOST, RHOST, etc)
    - [ ]
- [ ] Payload Development
    - [ ] Automatic payload generation
    - [ ] Integrate with established communication method
    - [ ] Modular options to include with payload

## Planned Features / Ideas
- [ ] Fully integrated C2 server with custom/modular callback methods, and daemon for designated longterm C2 servers
- [ ] Work with existing exploits written in Ruby, Python, etc. Existing post-exploitation tool integration
- [ ] Purpose-built exploit compiler and development tools
- [ ] Multi-target handling and fleet actions/control
- [ ] Containerization of target-handling processes to ensure host security
- [ ] Partially automate workflow of payload generation and C2 configuration
