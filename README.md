>Modular exploit development, testing, and post-exploitation framework (proof-of-concept)

This currently exists as a method for me to learn Ruby and improve my exploit development and programming abilities

## Planned Features / Ideas
- [ ] Fully integrated C2 server with custom/modular callback methods, and daemon for designated longterm C2 servers
- [ ] Work with existing exploits written in Ruby, Python, etc. Existing post-exploitation tool integration
- [ ] Purpose-built exploit compiler and development tools
- [ ] Multi-target handling and fleet actions/control
- [ ] Containerization of target-handling processes to ensure host security
- [ ] Partially automate workflow of payload generation and C2 configuration
