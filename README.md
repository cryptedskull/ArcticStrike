  <h1>Arctic Strike</h1> <b>Modular exploit development, testing, and post-exploitation framework (proof-of-concept)</b>
  <br></br>
  <p>This currently exists as a method for me to learn Ruby and improve my exploit development and programming abilities. It is not currently in an operational state, so use at your own dismay. Only setup as a basic framework.</p>
  <p>Currently only functional on Linux systems</p>
